    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're analyzing a subset of patents and want to do some text analysis of the first independent claim. To do this, you'd need to be able to join your list of patent publication numbers with a dataset containing the patent text. Additionally, you'd need a method to extract the first claim from the rest of the claims. This notebook is a demonstration of one method to perform this analysis using python, BigQuery, and Google's [new public dataset on patents](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/google-patents). \n",
    "\n",
    "What follows is a walkthrough of how to extract the first claim from a set of US Patent publications and run a few summary statistics against the first claim. The set of patents we analyze in this notebook is a random sample of 20,000 patents filed between 1995 and present in the G06F Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) code, however this analysis could be repeated for any arbitrary list of patents of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps we'll use to get there are:\n",
    "1. Create a new BigQuery \"dataset\" where we can store our results. For anyone new to bigquery, check out [the quickstart guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quickstart-web-ui).\n",
    "2. Upload a list of patent publications we wish to analyze.\n",
    "3. Join this list with Google's public patent data.\n",
    "4. Extract the first claim using regular expressions and BigQuery User Defined Functions.\n",
    "5. Calculate summary statistics about the first claims and plot results over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "- A google cloud account with access to BigQuery. If you don't have an account yet, [this page](https://cloud.google.com/free/) will guide you through the process to get started with an account and access the free tier of services.\n",
    "- Basic knowledge of how to run a query using the BigQuery web UI. If you're new to this, check out [this page](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/) for a quick intro.\n",
    "- Basic knowledge of [pandas dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) and python programming.\n",
    "- A few python packages (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and google-api-python-client."

BigQuery has [User Defined Functions (UDF's)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions) which let the user pass columns through some arbitrary function. In our case, we need some logic to parse the claims and split after the first claim has ended. In most cases we can simply split on the text \"1.\" but there are also cases where the text is not so cleanly formatted. The UDF below shows and example of using javascript regular expressions to parse the first claim.\n",
